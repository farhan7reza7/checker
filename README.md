"Computer is like a magnifier for human mental working capability with exceptional speed, storage, and memoryâ€”likewise as automobile is a magnifier to human movement, telecommunication is a magnifier to human communication-range, telescope/microscope is a magnifier to human vision capability, megaphone/speaker is a magnifier to human sound capability etc."

For example: assume GitHub company wants to make and send performance reports to its all users based upon the existing-data-of-the-users (exceptional storage of million of users data), then it can write a program to make a report for each user, and then send the same-user-report to the same user (exceptional memory), and this whole process for making and sending data to million of users not going to take more than a few minutes (exceptional speed).

"But not exceptional intelligence yet (you can see any chatbot, all making intelligence based errors, even sometimes such stupid errors which humans do not unless mentally ill)".

Imagine a human having an exceptional amount of data related to the humans' needs, memory, and the most important exceptional energy, then that person will always answer satisfactorily to human needs because such programmed human will understand other humans based upon the situation of the human asking questions, psychological state/needs for the kind of answer, other psychological aspects for the maximum impactful and satisfactory answer etc. If that person makes such stupid errors as computers do sometimes, then some will not leave any chance to call such stupid a mad or senseless or mentally ill (But not such thinking/saying for computer programs (Robotics) or own actions, if some think so about others, then rethink about own actions too and check if those were mentally strong or ill, and judge self first and then others), for this that person will always take care(extra care) to not give some any opportunity for being called such things (But computer programs not yet work that way)( while some do not even care for such things, so chances are higher that some can be proved mentally ill scientifically based upon own actions than the person whom some are just only assuming for such things but can almost never prove it, while some can be when it comes to scientific criteria because scientific criteria are mostly created by such people whom some are just only assuming for such things ).

"It depends on how exceptionally intelligent you program a computer (or a computer program), computer knows nothing but only sets of instructions what programmers write for doing what they want/needed."
